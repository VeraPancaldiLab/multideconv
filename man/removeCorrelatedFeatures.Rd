\title{Remove high correlated cell deconvolution features}
\usage{
removeCorrelatedFeatures(data, threshold, name, n_seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Deconvolution matrix}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for defined high correlated features}

\item{name}{Cell type name corresponding to the given matrix in 'data'}

\item{n_seed}{Seed to ensure reproducibility regarding the choice of the feature.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\itemize{
\item Deconvolution matrix with only one deconvolution feature per high-correlated pair.
\item Highly correlated features found
\item Cell type name
}
}
\description{
If two deconvolution features within a specific cell type are found to be highly correlated, one feature is kept randomly for further analysis.
}
\examples{

data("deconvolution")

data = removeCorrelatedFeatures(deconvolution, high_corr, "B_cells", seed = 123)
