\usage{
compute.deconvolution.analysis(
  deconvolution,
  corr = 0.7,
  seed = NULL,
  cells_extra = NULL,
  file_name = NULL,
  return = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deconvolution}{Deconvolution output of compute.deconvolution() with features as columns and samples as rows}

\item{corr}{Minimum correlation threshold for subgroupping the deconvolution features}

\item{seed}{A numeric value to specificy the seed. This ensures reproducibility during the choice step of high correlated features.}

\item{cells_extra}{A string specifying the cells names to consider and that are not including in the nomenclature of multideconv (see Readme)}

\item{file_name}{A string specifying the file name of the .csv file with the deconvolution subgroups}

\item{return}{Boolean value to whether return and saved the plot and csv files of deconvolution generated during the run inside the Results/ directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\itemize{
\item A matrix with the deconvolution after processing
\item The deconvolution subgroups per cell type
\item The deconvolution subgroups composition
\item The deconvolution groups discarded caused they are all belonging to the same method
\item The discarded features because they contain a high number of zeros across samples (> 90\%)
\item Discarded features due to low variance across samples
\item Discarded cell types because they are not supported in the pipeline
\item High correlated deconvolution pairs (>high_corr)
}
