    abstract = {The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing.We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.A snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune\_deconvolution\_benchmark. An R package allows the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {In silico cell-type deconvolution from bulk transcriptomics data is a powerful technique to gain insights into the cellular composition of complex tissues. While first-generation methods used precomputed expression signatures covering limited cell types and tissues, second-generation tools use single-cell RNA sequencing data to build custom signatures for deconvoluting arbitrary cell types, tissues, and organisms. This flexibility poses significant challenges in assessing their deconvolution performance. Here, we comprehensively benchmark second-generation tools, disentangling different sources of variation and bias using a diverse panel of real and simulated data. Our study highlights the strengths, limitations, and complementarity of state-of-the-art tools shedding light on how different data characteristics and confounders impact deconvolution performance. We provide the scientific community with an ecosystem of tools and resources, omnideconv, simplifying the application, benchmarking, and optimization of deconvolution methods.Competing Interest StatementFF consults for iOnctura.
